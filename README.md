## Abstract:
Forest fires increasingly pose a threat to ecosystems and society. In Mediterranean climates, prolonged periods of drought, rising temperatures, and increased forest mass have heightened the virulence and frequency of large forest fires. While forest management policies can contribute to reduce this threat, being able to recognize patterns of occurrence and identify the risk of fire is beneficial for anticipating and avoiding dangerous situations that could lead to the ignition of a forest fire.

The ignition of a forest fire depends on multiple variables related to the type of fuel, geomorfology and meteorological conditions, mainly temperature, humidity, and wind. Including all these factors in a risk prediction model and obtaining results with a high degree of quality is a challenge to be achieved in this Master's project. Thus, the main goal of this project is to generate maps of forest fire risk using an artificial neural network that enables to spatially identify whether there is a risk of forest fire under certain meteorological and terrain conditions.
